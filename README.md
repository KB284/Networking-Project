### Utilizing Kali Linux
> I will be using Kali linux for my OS when capturing pakets. To use a wi-fi source, I need to obtain a wireless adapter so that the OS can capture a wireless source since it cannot be done without one. Until I have obtained one I will use Windows and experiment until then.
