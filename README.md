## Utilizing Kali Linux
 I will be using Kali linux for my OS when capturing pakets. To use a wi-fi source, I need to obtain a wireless adapter so that the OS can capture a wireless source since it cannot be done without one. Until I have obtained one I will use Windows and experiment until then.
### What is Kali Lunix?
 Linux is the operatng system, but there are different branches of Linux and Kali is one of them. Originated from Debian, Kali Linux is an OS that is popular for hackers to use due to its potential for penetration testing and utilization of a number of tools that come with the software.

## Using Kali Linux
This is just a preview of the software that will be used for the project in regards to packet capturing. Need a component to fully operate the software to the best of my ability.

## Using Windows
This is showing that Wireshark is operable on windows platform. The end goal is to understand how to use this software and perform proper packet capturing (proper as in understanding what has been captured and how to utilize the data obtained from a run).
